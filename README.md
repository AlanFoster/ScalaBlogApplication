C# MVC4 Blog Application
-------------------------

This is just a basic CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application that will help maintain blog posts and user comments.
I am purposely re-inventing the wheel in order to get familiar with the internals of C# MVC4 development.

Some technologies/concepts I hope to explore within this project are

- C# MVC4
- LESS/SASS
- BDD within C# (Specflow?)
- AJAX/HTML5/CSS3
