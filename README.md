Scala Blog Application
-------------------------

This application investigates the use of the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) to create a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application that will help maintain blog posts and user comments.
I am purposely re-inventing the wheel in order to get familiar with the internals of Scala + Play development, which I am new to. This application is purely investigative and does not represent a real world implementation.

Some of the technologies used within this project are

- [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/)
- [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) - Other Database Access libraries investigated such as [Anorm](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/ScalaAnorm) and [Squeryl](http://squeryl.org/)

###Conclusion

The [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) is initially very promising. The compile time view errors were exceptional, and I would greatly appreciate such feedback within a production application. A paradigm shift is required when interacting with Database Access libraries such as [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/), however the benefits are apparent when used appropriately.
