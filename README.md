Scala Blog Application
-------------------------

This is just a basic CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application that will help maintain blog posts and user comments.
I am purposely re-inventing the wheel in order to get familiar with the internals of Scala + Play development, which I am new to.

Some technologies/concepts I hope to explore within this project are

- Scala
- Slick/Anorm/Squeryl
- LESS/SASS
- Testing
    - Play's OOTB selenium integration
    - BDD
- AJAX/HTML5/CSS3
